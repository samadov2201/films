            <h1>About Robert</h1>

            
            <p>Robert Douglas Thomas Pattinson was born May 13, 1986 in London, England, to Richard Pattinson, a car
            dealer importing
            vintage cars, and Clare Pattinson (n√©e Charlton), who worked as a booker at a model agency. He grew up
            in Barnes,
            southwest London with two older sisters. Robert discovered his love for music long before acting and
            started learning
            the guitar and piano at the age of four. He became a big cinephile for love of auteur cinema in his
            early teens and
            preferred to watch films rather than doing his homework. In his late teens and early twenties, he used
            to perform solo
            acoustic guitar gigs at open mic nights in bars and pubs around London where he sung his own written
            songs.
            </p> <p> Thinking
            about becoming a musician or going to university to study speech-writing, he never thought about
            pursuing an acting
            career and his drama teacher in school even advised him not to join the drama club because she thought
            he wasn't made
            for the creative subjects. But as a teenager, he joined the local amateur theatre club after his father
            convinced him to
            attend because he was quite shy. At age 15 and after two years of working backstage, he auditioned for
            the play 'Guys
            and Dolls' and he got his first role as a Cuban dancer with no lines. He got the lead part in the next
            play 'Our Town',
            was spotted by a talent agent who was sitting in the audience and he began looking for professional
            roles.
