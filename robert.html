            <h1>About Robert</h1>

            <a>
                Robert Douglas Thomas Pattinson was born May 13, 1986 in London, England, to Richard Pattinson, a car
                dealer importing
                vintage cars, and Clare Pattinson (n√©e Charlton), who worked as a booker at a model agency. He grew up
                in Barnes,
                southwest London with two older sisters. Robert discovered his love for music long before acting and
                started learning
                the guitar and piano at the age of four. He became a big cinephile for love of auteur cinema in his
                early teens and
                preferred to watch films rather than doing his homework. In his late teens and early twenties, he used
                to perform solo
                acoustic guitar gigs at open mic nights in bars and pubs around London where he sung his own written
                songs. Thinking
                about becoming a musician or going to university to study speech-writing, he never thought about
                pursuing an acting
                career and his drama teacher in school even advised him not to join the drama club because she thought
                he wasn't made
                for the creative subjects. But as a teenager, he joined the local amateur theatre club after his father
                convinced him to
                attend because he was quite shy. At age 15 and after two years of working backstage, he auditioned for
                the play 'Guys
                and Dolls' and he got his first role as a Cuban dancer with no lines. He got the lead part in the next
                play 'Our Town',
                was spotted by a talent agent who was sitting in the audience and he began looking for professional
                roles.
