                Top Gun: Maverick is a 2022 American action drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski. It is the sequel to
                the 1986 film
                Top Gun and the second installment in the Top Gun film series. Written by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren
                Singer, and
                Christopher McQuarrie, the film is based on a story by Peter Craig and Justin Marks. It stars Tom Cruise
                and Val Kilmer
                reprising their roles from the original film, alongside Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen
                Powell, Lewis
                Pullman, and Ed Harris. In the film, Maverick confronts his past while training a group of younger Top
                Gun graduates,
                including the son of his deceased best friend, for a dangerous mission.

                Development of a Top Gun sequel was announced in 2010 by Paramount Pictures. Cruise, along with producer
                Jerry
                Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott, were asked to return. Craig wrote a draft of the screenplay in
                2012, but the
                project stalled when Scott died later that year.[5] The film was later dedicated to Scott's memory.[6]
                Production
                resumed in 2017 after Kosinski was hired to direct. Principal photography, which involved the use of
                IMAX-certified 6K
                full-frame cameras, took place from May 2018 to April 2019 in California, Washington, and Maryland. An
                initial release
                date was scheduled for July 12, 2019, but it was delayed several times due to the complex action
                sequences and the
                COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, several streaming companies attempted to buy the streaming
                rights to the film
                from Paramount, but all offers were declined on the orders of Cruise, who insisted the film be released
                exclusively in
                cinemas.[7]
